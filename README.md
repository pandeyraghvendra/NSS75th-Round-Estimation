# NSS75th-Round-Estimation
In this repository, I have worked on NSS 75th round data, specifically on schedule 25.2( education expenditure). I have estimated various soci0-economic indicators and matched it with published result. Quite often people face problem when they work on NSS text files separated by fix width. That's why I have used .txt file for my analysis.
